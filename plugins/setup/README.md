# Setup Plugins

Setup plugins help new users set up DART to work with a specific repostory or
storage backend. For example, the APTrust setup plugin automatically installs
the APTrust BagIt profile and then walks the user through a series of questions
such as "What is APTrust API key?", "What is your AWS secret key?", etc.

Without a setup plugin, a user would have to visit several different screens
to enter information about remote network services, application preferences,
bagging preferences, etc.
