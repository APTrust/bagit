# Easy Store - Electron

Experimenting with Electron as a UI front-end for easy-store.

Download Electron from https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/tag/v1.7.6

For Mac, you'll want https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/download/v1.7.6/electron-v1.7.6-darwin-x64.zip.

Unzip that and drag Electron into your Applications folder. You can then run this app from the command line like this:

`/Applications/Electron.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron electron/app`

It doesn't do much yet.
