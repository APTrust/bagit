WASHINGTON - President Trump continued his attacks on Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Tuesday, reviving his campaign call to investigate Hillary Clinton's "crimes" as he criticized Mr. Sessions's inaction.His two early morning Twitter posts were the latest in a string of attacks on Mr. Sessions that began when he told The New York Times in an interview that he never would have appointed Mr. Sessions to be attorney general if he had known he would recuse himself from the Justice Department's investigation into the Trump campaign's ties with Russia. The recusal was the first in a series of steps that led to the appointment of a special counsel to oversee that investigation.Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-mails & DNC server) & Intel leakers!- Donald J.
